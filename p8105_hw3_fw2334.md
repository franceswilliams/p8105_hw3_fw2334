# Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart") 
```

The `instacart` dataset includes information regarding online grocery
orders in 2017. There are 1384617 observations in the dataset, each row
being a product ordered, and there are 131209 unique users. The dataset
has 15 variables, including `days_since_prior_order`, `product_name`,
`aisle` where the product is from, and `reordered`, which indicates if
the user has previously ordered the product. An example: order ID \#1
refers to an order of Bulgarian Yogurt, Organic 4% Milk Fat Whole Milk
Cottage Cheese, Organic Celery Hearts, Cucumber Kirby, Lightly Smoked
Sardines in Olive Oil, Bag of Organic Bananas, Organic Hass Avocado,
Organic Whole String Cheese. The variable `days_since_prior_order` = 9,
indicating that this user last ordered groceries on instacart nine days
ago.

``` r
aisle_df = instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(item_count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(item_count))
```

There are 134 aisles, and the most items are ordered from `fresh
vegetables` and `fresh fruits`.

``` r
aisle_plot = aisle_df %>%
  filter(item_count >= 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, item_count)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = item_count)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "pink") +
    coord_flip()

aisle_plot
```

Fruits and vegetables were by far the most ordered products, followed by
yogurt. All other products were ordered fewer than 50,000 times.

### Table

##### Light brown sugar, 499

##### 975

``` r
aisles_table = instacart %>%
  filter(aisle == c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(product_name_count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(product_rank = rank(-product_name_count)) %>% 
  filter(product_rank <= 3) %>% 
  mutate(product_info = paste(product_name, product_name_count, sep = ", n = ")) %>% 
  select(-product_name, -product_name_count) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = aisle,
    values_from = product_info)

knitr::kable(aisles_table)
```

| product\_rank | baking ingredients               | dog food care                                           | packaged vegetables fruits     |
| ------------: | :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------- |

### Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream

##### 0 is Sunday - assign Sunday to 0

``` r
apples_icecream_table = instacart %>% 
  select(product_name, order_dow, order_hour_of_day) %>% 
  filter(product_name == "Pink Lady Apples" | product_name == "Coffee Ice Cream") %>% 
  mutate(order_day = as.numeric(order_dow)) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_day) %>% 
  mutate(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  select(-order_hour_of_day, -order_dow) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = product_name,
    values_from = mean_hour) %>% 
  arrange(order_day) %>% 
  separate("Pink Lady Apples", c("apples_hr", "apples_min"), 2) %>% 
  separate("Coffee Ice Cream", c("icecream_hr", "icecream_min"), 2) %>% 
  mutate(
    apples_minute = round(as.numeric(apples_min)*60),
    ice_cream_minute = round(as.numeric(icecream_min)*60),
    pink_lady_apples = paste(apples_hr, apples_minute, sep = ":"),
    coffee_ice_cream = paste(icecream_hr, ice_cream_minute, sep = ":")) %>% 
  select(order_day, pink_lady_apples, coffee_ice_cream)
```

### Table 1: Mean time of day

``` r
knitr::kable(apples_icecream_table)
```

| order\_day | pink\_lady\_apples | coffee\_ice\_cream |
| ---------: | :----------------- | :----------------- |
|          0 | 13:26              | 13:46              |
|          1 | 11:22              | 14:19              |
|          2 | 11:42              | 15:23              |
|          3 | 14:15              | 15:19              |
|          4 | 11:33              | 15:13              |
|          5 | 12:47              | 12:16              |
|          6 | 11:56              | 13:50              |

Coffee ice cream was on average ordered later in the day than pink lady
apples.
